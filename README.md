# OBSTACLE-AVOIDING-ROBOT-WITH-PWM-MOTOR-CONTROL
This project implements an autonomous obstacle-avoiding robot using an ultrasonic sensor, Arduino, and L298N motor driver, with motor speed controlled via an analog PWM signal generated by a 555 timer, combining hardware-based speed control with intelligent navigation.
