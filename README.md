# OBSTACLE-AVOIDING-ROBOT-WITH-PWM-MOTOR-CONTROL
This project implements an autonomous obstacle-avoiding robot using an ultrasonic sensor, Arduino, and L298N motor driver, with motor speed controlled via an analog PWM signal generated by a 555 timer, combining hardware-based speed control with intelligent navigation.
## Objectives
- Detect obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor
- Avoid collisions through intelligent direction control
- Control motor speed using analog PWM (555 timer) instead of software PWM
- Demonstrate integration of analog electronics and embedded systems

## Working Principle
- The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, mounted on a servo motor, scans the surroundings.
- The Arduino Uno processes distance measurements and decides the robot’s movement (forward, left, right, or stop).
- The L298N motor driver controls the direction of DC motors.
- A 555 timer IC configured in astable mode generates a variable-duty-cycle PWM signal.
- This PWM signal is applied to the ENA and ENB pins of the L298N driver to control motor speed.
- Motor speed is adjusted manually using a potentiometer connected to the 555 timer circuit.
